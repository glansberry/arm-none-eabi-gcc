Building GCC on a MinGW host is pretty tough. Here is a bash script for building
a gcc cross-compiler on a MinGW host. The compiler targets arm-non-eabi with the
thumb2 instruction set. This configuration is used for development on the ARM
Cortex-M3 architecture.

The script requires MinGW and the native gcc-4.7.1 compiler
https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingwbuilds/files/latest/download?source=files

To use this script:

git clone git@github.com:joshuanapoli/arm-none-eabi-gcc.git
cd arm-none-eabi-gcc
./build-arm-none-ebai-gcc

By default, the compiler will be installed under /opt/gnu/gcc-4.7.1. You may
want to customize the installation path and versions at the beginning of the
script.

The build coughs and sputters. Some tests run by autoconf will open dialog boxes
which must be manually cleared. The PCL build may hang while "checking if the
compiler has the remainder bug". Kill the conftest.exe process to continue.
